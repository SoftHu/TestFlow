Start -->1737561216085206[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr Quack:</b>

Hey, hey, heyâ€”
What are you doing!
That's so rude!
How dare you sit on The Quack without permission?
Are you trying to squish him?
It's lucky he got out of your way!]
1737561216085206 -->1737561216085209{ }
1737561216085209 -->|I thought you were a benchâ€¦|1737561216085210[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr Quack:</b>

You make a fair point...
But The Quack still strongly condemns you!
He just wants to be alone here, 
reminiscing about a past lover, UNDISTURBED!]
1737561216085209 -->|Aren't benches made for sitting on?|1737561216085210[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr Quack:</b>

1737561216085210 -->1737561216086237{ }
1737561216086237 -->|Don't let me disturb you then.|1737561216086238[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr Quack:</b>

The Quack really wanted to share his story with youâ€¦
What a pity, come back and find him when you want to listen.]
1737561216086237 -->|Tell me your story.|1737561216086240[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr Quack:</b>

That day, The Quack was admiring the scenery by the sea,
just like now. A beautiful girl passed by,
fell in love with him at first sight and sat on him.]
1737561216086238 -->1737561216086239[End]
1737561216086240 -->1737561216087265[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

That was just her mistaking you for a benchâ€¦]
1737561216087265 -->1737561216087266[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr Quack:</b>

Not at all!
It was true love! True love!
Later, The Quack found out that 
this beautiful girl was actually a noble princess...
It's just a pity that The Quack is not a prince,
and our brief romance had to come to an end.
She wants to take Bobo along, but he gets seasick and is afraid of water.
Looking back, he still regrets that decision!
If only The Quack had been braver.]
1737561216087266 -->1737561216087269{ }
1737561216087269 -->|How vulgar...|1737561216088294[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr Quack:</b>

Speaking of which,
when the princess said goodbye,
she tossed a package to The Quack from the ship.
Sadly, the ship was already far away,
so the package fell into the water...
The Quack is so curious to find out what's inside!
Maybe it's a parting gift? Or a letter from the princess?
It's so frustrating! The Quack is naturally afraid of water. 
Staying at the dock is already pushing his limits...]
1737561216087269 -->|How tragic...|1737561216088294[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr Quack:</b>

Although a frog being afraid of water is quite suspicious,
helping him won't hurt.
Try transforming into a slime and investigating the nearby waters.]
