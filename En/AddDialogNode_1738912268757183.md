1738978209587366 -->|Tell me more about this place.|1738978401349804[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Of course, I can tell you lots about this place
and give you some tips for living here.
There's an ancient legend of this place...
about a great war between foxes and Tanuki.
The Tanuki once drove the foxes away, taking over this land.
But one day, a nine-tailed fox stood up,
protected the other foxes and defended their last 
sanctuary.
In the land of &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;, you will find many fox shrines.
These shrines were built to commemorate
that brave nine-tailed fox.
If you wish, you can help tidy these shrines up
and the gods may reciprocate.]
