With your attitude as a yokai,

nobody would encourage you to enter a talent show.

But I've thought it over carefully

I really haven't been putting in the effort or taking my passion seriously,
like other bakers do.
If I didn't have the mayor's aura,
could I honestly say I truly love baking...?

But I don't want to join the show.
I like my life as it is now.
