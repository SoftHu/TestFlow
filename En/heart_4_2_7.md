This photo was taken in the rainforests near the equator.
If you don't look closely, you'll miss the chameleon
camouflaged as a leaf. Nature is truly amazing &#40;〃'▽'〃&#41;
And this one!
Mum said that Shikoku was hosting a grand celebration.
The parade was so long, you couldn't see the end of it...
I really want to take part in lively events like that too... &#40;*❦ω❦&#41;
Speaking of which, all of the photos are great.
I love them all!
