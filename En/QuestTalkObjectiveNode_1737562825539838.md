You're here?
Have you finally decided to listen to The Quack's
romantic and poignant love story?]

1737563860176154 -->|I'm ready now.|1737563366322442[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr Quack:</b>

That day, The Quack was admiring the scenery by the sea,
just like now. A beautiful girl passed by,
fell in love with him at first sight and sat on him.]

That was just her mistaking you for a benchâ€¦]
1740654812464383 -->1737563366322444[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr Quack:</b>

Not at all!
It was true love! True love!
Later, The Quack found out that 
this beautiful girl was actually a noble princess...
It's just a pity that The Quack is not a prince,
and our brief romance had to come to an end.
She wants to take Bobo along, but he gets seasick and is afraid of water.
Looking back, he still regrets that decision!
If only The Quack had been braver.]

1737563366323471 -->|How vulgar...|1737563366323472[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr Quack:</b>

Speaking of which,
when the princess said goodbye,
she tossed a package to The Quack from the ship.
Sadly, the ship was already far away,
so the package fell into the water...
The Quack is so curious to find out what's inside!
Maybe it's a parting gift? Or a letter from the princess?
It's so frustrating! The Quack is naturally afraid of water. 
Staying at the dock is already pushing his limits...]

Although a frog being afraid of water is quite suspicious,
helping him won't hurt.
Try transforming into a slime and investigating the nearby waters.]
