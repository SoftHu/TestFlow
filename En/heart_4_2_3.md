Fishing is my escape.
Back home, strict rules ruled the roost.
But I found freedom by that deep pond.
Even though I've left my family now,
I still enjoy the tranquillity of fishing.]

1752150842246603 -->|Musashi's childhood home?
|1752150972573138[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Ahem, it's nothing worth mentioning.
But I'm really happy to find a new fishing buddy.
I used to go fishing with Uncle Torleone.
Instead of enjoying the process, he cared more about the size and weight of the catch,
so fishing with him always felt strangely competitive...]
1752150842246603 -->|Sounds like there's a story there.|1752150972573138[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

1752151238919635 -->|I don't really care about the outcomeâ€¦|1752151483876826[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

It seems we're on the same page when it comes to fishing.]
1752151238919635 -->|Actually, I do care about the catch.|1752151514554843[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Looks like you're as competitive as Uncle Torleone!
Haha, you must get along well with him.
But sometimes you should also just relax and enjoy the fishing itself.]

Look, speaking of which, a fish has just bitten!
When the paint arrives, I'll show you gyotaku.
It's the ancient art of printing fish shapes on paper.
From China's Song dynasty.
The finished gyotaku can be mounted and hung on the wall.
They're really worth collecting.]
1752151796367724 -->1752152897572205{ }
1752152897572205 -->|Sure!|1752152938692978[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Oh, I didn't realise how late it is.
That's it for today. I need to go back and feed Daifuku.
Well then, see you again soon.]
1752152897572205 -->|I'm looking forward to it.|1752152938692978[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Oh, I didn't realise how late it is.

This is my first time visiting Mr Musashi's home. Scratch scratch scratch.]
1752153011933557 -->1752153046167926[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

If Kon's up for it, you're welcome any time.
You've been griping about &lbrace;playername&rbrace; ditching you
and leaving you alone. Feeling lonely at home, huh?]
1752153046167926 -->1752153319985527{ }
1752153319985527 -->|Is that how Kon feels?|1752153555967358[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Just spend more time with me in the future and the kind Lord Kon will forgive you!]
1752153319985527 -->|I might have overlooked Kon's feelings.|1752153555967358[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

1752153555967358 -->1752153607355775[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

You two have a great relationship, truly like siblings.
Hey, I heard you've been poking around those ruins lately.
Dangerous stuff.
I've got a buddy from the islands fetching emergency meds for you.]
1752153607355775 -->1752153731191168{ }
1752153731191168 -->|Thank you.|1752153832661383[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

We're friends, aren't we?
Don't worry about it!]
1752153731191168 -->|That's so thoughtful.|1752153832661383[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

We're friends, aren't we?
Don't worry about it!]
1752153832661383 -->1752153888458120[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

So, have you found anything interesting in the ruins?
Tell us what it is!]
1752153888458120 -->1752153915281801{ }
1752153915281801 -->|I had a fight with a Tanuki!|1752153949910412[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Eh? &#40;Shocked&#41;]
1752153949910412 -->1752153997110669[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

There are Tanuki in Seikyu?!
That's truly unheard of.
Why would Tanuki come to Seikyu?
Could it be...
&#40;I handled everything flawlessly before, it's not possible...&#41;]
1752153997110669 -->1752154116159886{ }
1752154116159886 -->|You're acting suspicious!|1752154285366675[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

You... you misunderstood me!]
1752154116159886 -->|What's up with Tanuki?|1752154327645588[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Since the decline of the fox,
Tanuki have been fighting over territory.
Those vicious creatures wreak havoc everywhere.
I thought Seikyu was a sanctuary,
but it turns out Tanuki are lurking here too...
I need to inform the townspeople about this.
Seikyu isn't safe anymore, be extra careful on your way back.]

Musashi is usually so elegant and composed,
but he became quite flustered when Tanuki were mentioned...
Haha, he must really be scared of Tanuki!
But I'm not afraid of Tanuki!
If they dare to bully you, I'll scratch scratch scratch!
They'll definitely run away scared!]
